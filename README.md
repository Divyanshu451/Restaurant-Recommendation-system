Recommendation systems are a type of information filtering systems because they improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user.
These are active information filtering systems that personalize the information provided to a user based on their interests, relevance of the information, etc. Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.
A Restaurant recommendation system uses content-based filtering. This method only uses information about the description and attributes of items that users have previously consumed to model user preferences.
